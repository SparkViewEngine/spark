v1.0 -> v1.1 Breaking Changes
    # Shouldly.Should.Throw<TException> changed to return thrown exception when failed, rather than exception message
        FIX: Any code relying on Throw<T>() to return a string should update to call Message. Eg:
        Should.Throw<SomeException>(() => throw new OtherException()).Message.ShouldBe("Threw other exception");
    
    # Rhino Mocks has been deprecated from Shouldly. 
        Won't break build as such, but please bear in mind that plans are to remove this functionality from Shouldly
        This also means the NuGet package has been updated to remove the explicit dependency on Rhino.Mocks.
        
    # The following classes have been marked internal. They shouldn't have been marked public:
        Shouldly.ObjectHelpers
            T As<T>()
        Shouldly.ShouldlyCoreExtentions
            void AssertAwesomely<T>()
        Shouldly.TestEnvironment
        Shouldly.ShouldlyMessage
        Shouldly.ShouldlyMethodsAttribute
        Shouldly.StringHelpers
            string CommaDelimited<T>()
            string DelimitWith<T>()
            string Inspect()

        If you're using these methods, please implement locally before updating to v1.1
